<hr>
<span><strong>Gold</strong> (g) is an essential resource in The Pit. Similarly to XP, accumulating it is required to <a href="Prestige.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">prestige</a>.
<br><span>The following are some ways players obtain gold and increase their gold-earning rate:</span>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;" class="body">
<li>Killing players with a <strong>bounty</strong> will award the killer with the bounty.</li>
<li><strong>Gold Boost</strong> is an upgrade purchasable at level 10. Each tier grants an additional +10% more gold from kills and ingots.</li>
<li><strong>Conglomerate</strong> is a perk unlocked in the Renown Shop. It removes the ability to earn XP, transmuting every XP earned into 0.20g.</li>

<li>The <strong>Highlander</strong> Megastreak grants the user +110% gold from all kills and the ability to earn one's bounty after dying. It is a Renown upgrade available at prestige <span class="me">VII</span>.</li>
<li>Renown upgrades such as <strong>Renown Gold Boost</strong>, <strong>Celebrity</strong>, and <strong>Co-op Cat</strong> are extremely useful for increasing a player's gold output.</li>

</ul>
<span>In order to prestige, a player needs to have grinded a certain amount of gold. This does not necessarily mean that the player needs to have that amount of gold in their inventory; the gold needs to have been earned at any point during the prestige.</span><br><span>Actions such as trading do not count towards the gold requirement.</span><br>
