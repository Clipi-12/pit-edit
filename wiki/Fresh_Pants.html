<hr>
<span><strong>Fresh Pants</strong>, commonly referred to as "fresh", are unenchanted leather pants. Fresh pants can be enchanted into mystic pants with the Mysticism Renown upgrade.<br><span>There are several kinds of fresh pants in the game:</span>

<ul style="list-style-type: square;" class="body">
<li>Fresh red, orange, yellow, green, and blue pants;</li>
<ul><li> Confusingly, these pants are the only colors that players call "fresh pants". This is due to the reason that these colors are the most common, standard, and have been in the game for the longest. These pants are obtained from killing players with the Mysticism Renown upgrade and Care Packages.</li>
</ul>
<li>Fresh aqua pants, used for fishing;</li>
<li>Fresh dark pants, used to negate the effects of mystic pants;</li>
<li>Fresh rage pants, designed to be powerful against certain enchantments.</li>
<li>Fresh sewer pants, pants with the ability to turn into powerful mystic pants.</li>
</ul>
<span>To save inventory space, ten pairs of fresh pants can be merged into one Pants Bundle (pb).</span><br>
