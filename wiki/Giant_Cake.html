<hr>
<span><strong>Giant Cake</strong> is a minor event occuring in the Pit. The event lasts for 2 minutes.<br>When the event occurs, a giant cake, created by hundreds of smaller cakes in a cuboid shape, spawns in a random area of the map. Players are able to eat slices of the cake by right-clicking it, similar to vanilla Minecraft. However, by eating slices of the cake, players will receive gold. Most cake slices award 1 gold. This increases by 0.25 gold for every 50 cake slices eaten. Eating the last slice of a cake awards 5 gold, increasing by 1.25g for every 50 slices eaten.</span><br>
<span>Two additional types of cake exist in the giant cake:</span><br>
<span><strong>Cherries</strong>, which award 150 gold, increasing by 37.5g for every 50 slices eaten,</span><br>
<span><strong>Chocolate Chips</strong>, which award 100 XP. The XP earned from chocolate chips is unaffected by XP Boost.</span><br><br>
